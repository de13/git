# git

## First steps
We'll start by configuring git:

```bash
$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Then we will create a new project:

```bash
$ mkdir my_project
$ cd my_project
$ git init
```

We will now generate a first content, for example a README file:

```bash
$ echo "# My Awesome Project" > README.md
```

Now let's do our first commit:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "first commit"
[master (root-commit) f361cbb] first commit
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

Fanstatic! Now it's time to push this commit to our remote server:

```bash
$ git branch
$ git remote add origin git@localhost:/srv/git/demo.git
$ git push origin master

And voilÃ , here we are!
